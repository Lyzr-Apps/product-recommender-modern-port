Email sending fix completed successfully.

Problem: Agent was not actually calling the GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL tool when products were missing.

Changes made:
1. Agent instructions updated to be explicit about IMMEDIATELY calling GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL tool
   - Steps 13-15: Missing product detection now requires mandatory tool invocation
   - Steps 16-18: Email summary also requires mandatory tool invocation
   - Added general rules: "NEVER say 'I will send' — CALL the tool and say 'I have sent'"
2. Agent tested with missing product query — test PASSED with ticket_sent: true
3. UI updated to handle new response fields:
   - Added ticket_sent (boolean), summary_sent (boolean), email_recipient (string), comparison (string|null) to ResponseData
   - Updated parseAgentResponse in both paths to extract new fields
   - Ticket notification rendering now handles both ticket_notification (string) AND ticket_sent (boolean)
   - Comparison rendering now handles both comparison_notes and comparison fields
   - hasStructuredData check includes ticket_sent
